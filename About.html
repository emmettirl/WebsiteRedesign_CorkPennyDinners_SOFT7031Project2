                    <p>Cork Penny Dinners is a warm dry place in the heart of Cork City with a welcoming atmosphere. The
                        premises is open to all 7 days a week all year round, No questions are asked, no judgements are
                        made.</p>

                    <p>All our services are free of charge to those that need them. Our friendly volunteers ensure that
                        our
                        service users are well looked after on a daily basis. Our door is always open, we never judge,
                        we
                        serve.</p>

                    <p>Cork Penny Dinners is currently serving up to 2000 freshly made meals per week at our premises
                        compared to approximately 150 or less per week prior to the recession.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes a cup of tea, a handshake or a friendly chat can go a long way towards beating the
                        loneliness and isolation that is a big issue for many that come our way.</p>

                    <p>There has also been a huge increase in homelessness and mental health issues that are affecting
                        so
                        many people which have forced them to avail of our services.</p>

                    <p>In the last few years we have also seen a big increase in the number of families availing of our
                        service.</p>

                    <p>Our volunteers come from all walks of life; nurses, truck drivers, scientists, general
                        operatives,
                        musicians, teachers, students, solicitors, unemployed people, retired people and clergy. Our
                        volunteers are made up of many different nationalities, but what we all have in common is
                        empathy
                        for our fellow human beings and a willingness to offer a hand in support. Service users and
                        volunteers at Cork Penny Dinners interact with good humour and mutual respect always.</p>

                    <p>Food packages are also distributed to people in need. We do not have paid staff at Cork Penny
                        Dinners, all work is on a voluntary basis.</p>

                    <p>Cork Penny Dinners is a Charitable Trust. Our charitable objective is to feed those in need and
                        to
                        offer support to homeless people.</p>

                    <p>Cork Penny Dinners will have the opportunity to expand its services thanks to the phenomenal
                        generosity of fundraisers from Cork and beyond. In the near future service users of the
                        organisation
                        will benefit from a state of the art facility offering boundless educational opportunities. The
                        centre will also provide medical care and assistance in everyday administrative tasks. Located
                        in
                        James Street, the building will house a clinic operated by some 52 doctors. This service will be
                        operated on a rotatory and voluntary basis by local GPs. A full music programme run by voluntary
                        tutors will pave the way for the Cork Penny Dinners Orchestra. The idea behind this is to foster
                        social interactions while cultivating new skills. Classes in sewing, cooking and repair will be
                        put
                        in place to revive survival skills of old.</p>

                    <p>It is estimated that the project will cost in the region of €800,000. CPD Volunteer Coordinator,
                        Caitriona Twomey said she hopes the building can be a "one stop shop" to enhance existing
                        services
                        available to those experiencing financial difficulties. All services will be provided free of
                        charge.</p>

                    <p>"Our main objective is to help people achieve their dreams," Caitriona added. "Over time the
                        initiative will evolve and there are so many possibilities to look forward to." Service users
                        have
                        the option of free counselling sessions. The centre will act as a haven for abuse survivors who,
                        with professional support, can strive for solace and healing.</p>

                        Fundraising comes from individuals, companies, local organisations and businesses, social and
                        sporting clubs. Many help with donations from their voluntary fundraising events which they have
                        organised for the charity's benefit and also donate goods, produce and expertise. These
                        donations
                        are what enables the continuance of our service into the future.

                    <p>
                        As we do not fundraising ourselves we would like to extend a massive and sincere thanks to all
                        those
                        who have and continue to support the charity. We are very grateful to all those who organise and
                        take part in their voluntary fundraising efforts, food drives, challenges, quizzes, cake sales,
                        music gigs, sporting events, school events and so many other diverse initiatives. The goodwill
                        of
                        people has been absolutely outstanding.

                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>Penny Dinners Trustees Volunteer coordinator, Caitríona Twomey is the driving force behind Cork
                        Penny Dinners. Operating on a purely voluntary basis, she became involved with the charity some
                        years ago through her father Tom Lynch. During Caitríona’s childhood, Tom would devote much of
                        his Christmas Day to cooking hot meals for the homeless community in Cork. Then, following hours
                        of graft, he would return home and do the same for his children. “My father never told us where
                        he was going which only fuelled my curiosity”, Caitriona said. “I was thrilled when he agreed to
                        let me come with him one year. From helping out I was shocked to see the number of people
                        suffering. It made me realise how truly lucky I was.” Since then Caitríona has dedicated her
                        life to easing other people’s suffering. Her trained background as a psychotherapist attests to
                        this. A Cork Person of the Month award is among her many accolades. Caitríona’s teenage daughter
                        Alesha is already following in her footsteps after receiving the prestigious “Garda Youth Award’
                        for her ongoing charity work. “I believe in our ethos of being non-judgemental as that was
                        firmly rooted in my childhood,” Caitríona said. “My strong points are many, my weak points even
                        more. However, myself and the volunteers do a magnificent job everyday of the year. We Serve!”
                    </li>
                    <li>Gerald Kean began his first job with the late solicitor Michael Martin in Dublin before setting
                        up his own practice by the late 1980s. He set up his solicitor’s practice, Kean and Co., more
                        than 15 years ago. The businessman was initially introduced to Cork Penny Dinners after
                        volunteers invited him to participate in an event intended to raise the organisation’s profile.
                        The renowned solicitor was only too willing to join other celebrities in the kitchen as part of
                        a “volunteer experience.” While his duty on the day was simply peeling potatoes, he made quite
                        the impression on service users. His compassionate nature lent itself well to his volunteering
                        work in CPD in the years that followed. In 2014 he joined the CPD trustee board. Mr Kean is also
                        an accomplished author. He penned a book about his experience of featuring in the first season
                        of RTÉ’s Celebrity Banisteoir. He has appeared on numerous television shows through the years
                        including Tubridy Tonight, The Panel and Operation Transformation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Limerick native Gary Heslin felt compelled to join the Cork Penny Dinners team after learning of
                        their invaluable work from television show the Secret Millionaire which aired almost seven years
                        ago. The cause was close to his heart, given the number of people he encountered sleeping on the
                        streets during a normal working day. The now retired firefighter was so touched by their
                        appearance he decided to volunteer in the soup kitchen which dates back to famine times. Gary
                        spent 27 years working with Cork City Fire Brigade and has also garnered much respect in the
                        community through his voluntary work with the RNLI.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sarah Horgan developed a love for helping others after offering her services as a voluntary
                        make-up artist in Saint Patrick’s Marymount nine years ago. While she quit the beauty industry,
                        her love for charity remained. She worked as a freelance journalist for a number of years before
                        securing a job as a full time News Reporter with the Evening Echo newspaper. Her collection of
                        work saw her nominated in the regional journalist of the year category back in 2012. During the
                        course of her work Sarah was introduced to CPD and came to know many of its service users and
                        volunteers. Some of the voluntary work she has conducted through the charity includes the
                        Finding Your Voice Project which saw her teach journalism skills to three women rebuilding their
                        lives after homelessness. All three involved had their end of term pieces published by the
                        Evening Echo. Sarah’s hobbies include filmmaking, styling and coordinating fashion shoots.
