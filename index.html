                            <p>Cork Penny Dinners is a long-established charitable organisation whose core service is to

                                nourishing hot meal in a safe environment to all those in need.</p>

                            <p>Cork Penny Dinners will operate for as long as there is a need. To feed one person who is

                                is a worthwhile, simple, fundamental way to help that person.</p>

                            <p>The aim is to provide a warm, dry place to sit and eat, with a welcoming atmosphere, no

                                asked, no judgements made all, are welcomed with courtesy.</p>

                            <p>Service Users are expected to treat volunteers and facilities with the same respect and

                            <p>This ethos is founded on mutual respect and regard for the dignity of all: service users,

                            <p>Penny Dinners was founded during famine times as a soup kitchen and is one of Cork's
                                oldest
                                caring organisations.</p>

                            <p>While there is a formal record of establishment in 1888 (see below) it may have ties
                                right back
                                to the soup kitchens run by the Society of Friends (Quakers) at the time of the Famine
                                in the
                                1840’s.</p>

                            <p>The practise of paying one penny was established back then (at that time for a quart of
                                soup and
                                half a loaf of bread).</p>

                            <p>Due to the high demand of soup (1400 quarts per day reported in February 1847), a fast
                                method of
                                cooking was urgently needed, as the fires used up until this time took too long to heat
                                up and
                                cook the soup.</p>

                            <p>The Adelaide Street soup kitchen was adjacent to the shipyard run by Ebenezer Pike. They
                                piped
                                steam from the shipyard and blasted it into the great vats of soup thereby achieving a
                                much
                                quicker cooking time.</p>

                            <p>The Cork Examiner reported on 15th March 1888 that following the example of London and
                                Dublin, the “zeal of charitable ladies” in Cork had been stimulated, and a meeting had
                                been held in the Imperial Hotel.</p>
                            <p>This raised funds for the setting up of a facility at 5, Drawbridge Street. The system
                                proposed was that tickets each costing one penny would be sold to relieve “in a safe and
                                very effectual way the great distress which exists amongst us at present”</p>

                            <p>It also centres around fostering positive mental health with a programme designed to

                            <p> With this in mind, students are provided with a safe space to talk while preparing,

                            <h2>CORK MUSIC DOJO</h2>
                            <p>The Cork Penny Dinners team are passionate about bringing music to the masses,
                                irrespective of financial constraints. It was this belief that fuelled ambitions to
                                develop Cork Music Dojo which continues to go from strength to strength.</p>
                            <p>The initiative involves professional guitar teachers providing their time free of charge
                                to help others. A number of those who partook in the course have gone on to perform at

                            <h2>THE CORK HIGH HOPES CHOIR</h2>
                            <p>The Cork High Hopes Choir is a unique initiative bringing together singers affected by
                                homelessness. It operates under the umbrella of the national High Hopes Choir which was
                                the focus of a three-part RTÉ documentary based on the lives of those touched by
                                homelessness. </p>
                            <p>The choirs, which also exist in Dublin and Waterford, were created by former principal
                                conductor of the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, David Brophy. Cork’s High Hopes Choir have
                                amassed a number of musical accolades in recent years from belting out the Irish
                                national anthem at the Six Nations 2016 Ireland vs Italy game in the Aviva Stadium to
                                performing at Electric Picnic. </p>
                            <p>Nonetheless, choir members are already working hard to realise their lifelong dream of
                                one day singing in the Eurovision Song Contest.</p>

                            <h2>PENNY DRESSES</h2>
                            <p>While the main objective of Cork Penny Dinners is to feed the homeless and those down on
                                their luck, it also strives to improve the lives of children. In recent years it created
                                a service offering free communion dresses to struggling families. </p>
                            <p>The idea was set in motion after a single request from a family unable to meet the costs
                                of such an expensive occasion. Each year friends of Penny Dinners- including designers,
                                stylists and boutique owners-all pull together to ensure that no kid misses out on the
                                magical experience of shopping for their communion outfit due to financial
                                circumstances. </p>
                            <p>The result is a specially designed pop up shop featuring an array of new communion
                                dresses and suits. </p>
                            <p>“For the children it’s just a wonderful day out,” said founder of the initiative
                                Caitríona Twomey. “The set up means that families can still have the experience of
                                shopping for the dress/ suit with their children while feeling secure in the knowledge
                                that this is a completely confidential service.” </p>
                            <p>In the years since its inception Penny Dresses has received significant media coverage
                                and the range of outfits on offer featured on RTE’s the Today Show last year.</p>

                            <h2>CORK PENNY DINNERS MINDFULNESS</h2>
                            <p>Cork Penny Dinners strives to nourish people, not just physically, but spiritually as
                                well. Regular mindfulness sessions run by experienced professionals allow clients to
                                benefit from mindfulness in an encouraging environment. </p>
                            <p>Part of the rational behind this is to equip service users with the coping strategies
                                required during particularly difficult periods of their lives. The sessions also provide
                                a social outlet for people involved with the charity who wish to meet with friends
                                outside of the organisation’s operating hours. </p>
